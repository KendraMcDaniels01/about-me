      <p> 
        I graduated from Mountlake Terrace High School and later went on to take some classes in programming at Edmonds Community College. Enjoying the classes I would later go on to join Code fellows. 
        In my professional journey, I have accumulated experience primarily in office settings, with leasing and human resources being my most recent positions.
